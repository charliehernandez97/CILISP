NOT DONE
----------------------------------------
1. Task 5 is not fully implemented. Grammar is parsed correctly but the logic for custom functions is missing
2. Read is not fully implemented, does not check for errors
3. FreeNode() is incomplete, still get a couple of memory leaks

KNOWN ISSUES
----------------------------------------
1. On rare occassions, sometimes multiplying (or any other operation) a list of numbers returns the wrong
number type if the list of numbers contains both doubles and integers. This may be because the code is
not able to hold onto a specific NUM_TYPE due to the list of different types
2. Read() does not check for errors, so giving it an invalid input would result in the wrong result being outputted
3. COND is unable to read local variables, i.e (cond x y z). This may be because of the cond node being separate from the
scope node (?) or not making the proper connections during scoping
4. LAMBDA implementation missing, results in errors
